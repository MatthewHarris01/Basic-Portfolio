# Basic-Portfolio
A basic portfolio website
Version 2.0 -- index.html page completed (with favicon), contact.html page completed, portfolio page completed.
All styles in style.css, validated HTML and CSS for index, contact page, and portfolio. style.css has been validated.
NOTE: the portfolio page has an issue I was unable to resolve -- I used a table to hold images and labels for various projects (a total of 6) the imag for each project was set as a background fo the tble cell (the <td> element), however, I was unable to set the cell width after setting a background image, so there is a lot of unwanted white space in that table.
